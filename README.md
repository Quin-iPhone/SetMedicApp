## Environment Setup

To set up the environment for this project, you will need to have the following tools installed:

- Python (version 3.9 or higher)
- pip

To run this application, you need to set up environment variables for configuration and authentication. Create a file named `env.txt` (or `.env` if your framework requires it) in your project directory with the following content:

```env
SECRET_KEY=bK9$z@1!fQw7^LrT#Xe3pVj8ZsM0uBnY
FLASK_ENV=production
PORT=5000
USERNAME=your_username_here
PASSWORD=your_password_here
